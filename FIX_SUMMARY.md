# Forecast Calculation Fix Summary

## Issue
The forecast calculation in the budget_data table was incorrect. With budget=300.00 and actual=123.00, the forecast was showing 54.00 instead of the correct 177.00 (300 - 123).

## Root Cause
The UPDATE queries in ajax_handler.php and financial_report_section.php were using an overly complex and incorrect formula for calculating forecast and actual_plus_forecast values.

## Files Modified

1. **ajax_handler.php**
   - Fixed the UPDATE query for budget_data table
   - Simplified forecast calculation to: `forecast = COALESCE(budget, 0) - (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?)`
   - Fixed actual_plus_forecast calculation to: `actual_plus_forecast = (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?) + (COALESCE(budget, 0) - (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?))`
   - Updated parameter binding to match the new query structure

2. **financial_report_section.php**
   - Applied the same fixes as in ajax_handler.php
   - Simplified forecast calculation to: `forecast = COALESCE(budget, 0) - (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?)`
   - Fixed actual_plus_forecast calculation to: `actual_plus_forecast = (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?) + (COALESCE(budget, 0) - (COALESCE(actual, 0) + ?))`
   - Updated parameter binding to match the new query structure

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
- Forecast = Budget - Actual (the correct formula)
- Actual + Forecast = Budget (maintaining data consistency)
- All calculations are performed correctly when adding new transactions

## Test Results
With budget=300.00 and actual=123.00:
- Forecast should be 177.00 (300 - 123) ✓
- After adding a transaction of 50.00:
  - New Actual: 173.00 (123 + 50) ✓
  - New Forecast: 127.00 (300 - 173) ✓
  - Actual + Forecast: 300.00 (173 + 127) ✓
